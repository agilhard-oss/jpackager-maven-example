# jpackager-maven-example

Sample project for the jlink-jpackager-maven-plugin

## Prerequisites

- [JDK](http://jdk.java.net/)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [jlink-jpackager-maven-plugin](https://github.com/agilhard-oss/jlink-jpackager-maven-plugin)

You need to use the special JDK-12 Early Access build that includes JPackager support to use this goal.

This JPackager JDK-12 Early Access build can be downloaded from 
[https://jdk.java.net/jpackage/](https://jdk.java.net/jpackage/)

Alternatively you can also use the JDK-11 backported JPackager tool wich is mentioned in
[Filling the Packager gap - OpenJDK mailing list - Java.net](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/openjfx-dev/2018-September/022500.html)

The [link-jpackager-maven-plugin](https://github.com/agilhard-oss/jlink-jpackager-maven-plugin) is not (yet?)
available on maven central you must download,
compile and install that to your maven Repository before you can use this example.
